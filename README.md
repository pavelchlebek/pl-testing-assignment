# Project started via create-react-app

## raw solution of the task, I did not have enough time to debug the app / use best practice

## I am willing to discuss better practice over 2nd round of hiring process

## clone this public repo -> run "npm install" -> run "npm start" -> app should start on localhost:3000

## I used data.json file to get resources (caravans) instead of calling API

## should I call API, I would have used axios GET / endpoint in React.useEffect() hook, then I would filter
